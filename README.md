A custom Home Assistant integration to track your water consumption via the **HomeWizard Cloud**, designed specifically for their [battery-powered watermeter devices](https://www.homewizard.com/watermeter/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **TL;DR: Do you need this?**
> - :zap: **Don't have a Watermeter?** This is only for the Watermeter. Other HomeWizard devices work perfectly with the official integration.
> - :battery: **Running on Battery?** Yes, you need **this** integration.
> - :electric_plug: **Running on USB?** No, stop here! Use the [official HomeWizard Energy integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/homewizard/) for real-time local data.

## Why this integration?

The official [HomeWizard Energy](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/homewizard/) integration is amazing but has a limitation: it requires the **Local API**, which is disabled when the Watermeter runs on **batteries**.

**This integration bridges the gap:**
- :white_check_mark: Fetches data from the HomeWizard Cloud.
- :white_check_mark: Perfect for battery-powered setups (4 updates/day).
- :white_check_mark: High-resolution historical data (5-min intervals) injected into Long Term Statistics.
- :white_check_mark: Full Energy Dashboard support.

## Features

- **Device Support:** Automatically discovers all watermeter devices linked to your account.
- **Smart Tracking:** High-resolution consumption data (not just daily totals).
- **Diagnostics:** Monitor Online status and Wi-Fi signal strength.
- **Energy Dashboard:** Native integration with the Home Assistant Energy panel.
- **Auto-Sync:** Fetches the last 48h of data to ensure no drops, even if your Wi-Fi is flaky.
